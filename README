Step 1: Credentials
Follow this link to:
https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/create-audio-text-command-line
https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin

Generate a Google Cloud Platform profile,
Enable billing (won't be charged unless it's over a million requests a month)
Enable the speech API
Set up authentication
Download the credentials
This will result in a JSON file with your API private key, which you need to store in the "CRED" directory. Do NOT share this file with anybody, 
as it contains a private key. Anybody with this file can impersonate you in google cloud platform. For security, 
we can add all JSON files to .gitignore.

Step 2: Test the system
speech.py can be used for test. This will generate an audio file as referenced in https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-text-speech-python3?hl=en#8
however main.py invokes the interactive web based pronunciation app.
